# Dice-Roller

The Dice Roller is a simple project which allows the user to simulate a die being rolled.  

The user gets to select the number of sides the die will have.

The user then clicks ''Roll!'' to roll the die. The result displayed will be randomly generated, based on the number which was previously selected. 

The reset button allows the user to reset both the number of sides for the die, which returns to 4 by default, and also the result being displayed, which returns to 0 by default.
